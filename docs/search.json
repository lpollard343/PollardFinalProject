The website includes graphs and tables created by the students that showcase data from NEON metagenomes. The results are visual representations of data from the WREF collection site in Vancouver, WA as well as data on the bacteria phylum acidobacteriota. RESULTS"

    "text": "Data Collection Site: WREF\nThe Wind River Experimental Forest is a field site about 40 miles NE of Vancouver, WA in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. This is in Neon’s Pacific Northwest Domain (D16). The area is populated by douglas firs and western hemlocks of diverse ages. The region’s climate is temperate with an average temperature of 9.2°C and average precipitation of 87.6 in. In the valley of volcanoes, Mt. Rainier and Mt. St. Helens, the soil here is comprised of volcanic ashe, pumice, basalt bedrock, and andesite (leftover from lava flows). Among the animals living in this area are elk, bobcats, cougars, black bears, various birds, and many small mammals. After being used as a seedling nursery for post-wildfire forest rehabilitation for almost a century, the NEON site was established in 2006 and sampling for the project began in 2018.\n\n\n\nA beautiful view of a lake in the WREF site\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of the WREF site"

    "text": "Bacterial Phylum: Acidobacteriota\nThis phylum of bacteria is gram-negative and are most prevalent in soils (though they are present in a myriad of different mediums) (@Wikipedia). The name “acidobacteriota” comes from their acidophilic– or acid loving– nature. Many species thrive in acidic environments. The majority of them are also aerobic while a minority in anaerobic. The first species of this phylum was characterized in the early 90’s (Acidobacterium capsulatum), however, the phylum itself was not identified until the 2010’s (@huber_editorial_2022. Within this phylum 22 genera and 40 species have been identified.\n\n\n\nAcidobacterium cf. capsulatum"
