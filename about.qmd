# Abstract

Utilizing the coding knowledge and skills learned in Biology 476: Evolutionary Genomics and Bioinformatics, students built a github repository and Quatro website. The website includes graphs and tables created by the students that showcase data from NEON metagenomes. The results are visual representations of data from the WREF collection site in Vancouver, WA as well as data on the bacteria phylum acidobacteriota. RESULTS
