The website includes graphs and tables created by the students that showcase data from NEON metagenomes. The results are visual representations of data from the WREF collection site in Vancouver, WA as well as data on the bacteria phylum Acidobacteriota. RESULTS\n\n# Motivating Reasons\n\nThe motivating reasons behind this project were to further develop my skills in R Posit Cloud, to practice integration and manipulation of data, and to learn about Acidobacteriota and the WREF site. I took Biology 478: Human Genome Analysis in the fall of 2023 and this gave me some foundational skills for working with data in R. Through my engagement with this project, I have learned more about data wrangling, ggplot, ggtrees, quatro website building, and github repositories. These will be very useful to my future career in biological research as I will be able to analyze and present data that I have collected myself for presentations and papers. The topic of this project, acidobacteriota and WREF, have given me insight into a particular bacterial phylum and its evolutionary lineage. It also shed light onto how data collection sites are chosen, managed, and utilized.\n\n# Introduction\n\n## NEON Data\n\nThe National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a collective working towards better understanding ecosystems in the United States and how they are changing. It is comprised of data collected from across the country including freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems ranging from steams and rivers to deserts. Through collaboration between a myriad of scientific communities it has collected information with the aim of optimizing technology and construction to maintaining ecosystems.\n\n## Data Collection Site: WREF\n\nThe Wind River Experimental Forest is a field site about 40 miles NE of Vancouver, WA in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest (@NEON). This is in Neon's Pacific Northwest Domain (D16). The area is populated by douglas firs and western hemlocks of diverse ages. The region's climate is temperate with an average temperature of 9.2°C and average precipitation of 87.6 in. In the valley of volcanoes, Mt. Rainier and Mt. St. Helens, the soil here is comprised of volcanic ashe, pumice, basalt bedrock, and andesite (leftover from lava flows). Among the animals living in this area are elk, bobcats, cougars, black bears, various birds, and many small mammals. After being used as a seedling nursery for post-wildfire forest rehabilitation for almost a century, the NEON site was established in 2006 and sampling for the project began in 2018.\n\n![A beautiful view of a lake in the WREF site](WREFsitepretty.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![Map of the WREF site](WREFmap.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Bacterial Phylum: Acidobacteriota\n\nThis phylum of bacteria is gram-negative and are most prevalent in soils (though they are present in a myriad of different mediums) (@Wikipedia). The name \"acidobacteriota\" comes from their acidophilic– or acid loving– nature. Many species thrive in acidic environments. The majority of them are also aerobic while a minority in anaerobic. The first species of this phylum was characterized in the early 90's (Acidobacterium capsulatum), however, the phylum itself was not identified until the 2010's (@huber_editorial_2022. Within this phylum 22 genera and 40 species have been identified.\n\n![Acidobacterium cf. capsulatum](Acidobacterium.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Methods\n\nWe used Rstudio Posit-Cloud to wrangle, organize, analyze and graphically present the NEON MAGs data for the WREF site and the phylum Acidobacteria. In a Quatro Markdown file we inserted our code chunks that contained data which we had filtered, mutated, joined, and separated just to name a few functions utilized. To present this data we used tools like ggplot, facet wrap, geom bar, geom point, and ggtrees to create elaborate and well-formatted graphs with appropriate titles and keys.\n\n# Results\n\n## NEON Data\n\n![Datatable of MAG counts at each NEON site](Screenshot%202024-05-16%20at%2010.59.56%20PM.png)\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#datatable1 >}}\n\n\n\n![Data table of MAG counts per Phylum](DT%20of%20phylum%20MAG%20counts.png)\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#datatable2 >}}\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#plot1 >}}\n\n\n\nThe graph above displays the MAG counts at each NEON subplot and is colored by site.\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#plot2 >}}\n\n\n\nThe graph above displays the total number of MAGs at each site and is colored by fill.\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#plot3 >}}\n\n\n\nThe graph above displays the count of novel bacteria genera discovered per their phyla.\n\n## WREF Site Data\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#plot4 >}}\n\n\n\nThe graph above displays the number of MAGs in each phylum at WREF and is colored by class.\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#tree7 >}}\n\n\n\nThe tree above displays the phylum of bacteria found at WREF.\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#plot11 >}}\n\n\n\nThe bar graph above displays the bin quality, medium (MQ) or high (HQ), of the data collected from WREF.\n\n\n{{< embed code.qmd#plot12 >}}\n\n\n\nThe bar graph above displays the soil composition found at WREF.

They are found across ecosystem subtypes and at each and every NEON site. This includes everything from wetlands to tropical forests to deserts. They were sampled at temperatures between 2 and 28 degrees Celsius. They were found at pHs as high as 8 and as low as 3 displaying their acidophilic behavior. They are reportedly found in environments of even lower pH but the areas sampled do not include those. Acidobacteria also made up the third largest data set amongst the phyla.\n\nThe WREF site contained bacteria from a myriad of phyla and it had the fourth largest data set. However, its bin quality was medium for the most part with a much smaller portion of high quality. The soil in the samples was composed of 3/4 organic material and 1/4 minerals. The soil temperature ranged from 13 to 16 degrees celsius and the soil in water pH ranged from about 4 to 5. The samples collected there ranged from areas of about 370 ft in elevation to almost 700 ft.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nThe data collected on acidobacteriota displays their affinity for acidic environments to some degree but also goes to show that this phlyum is very versatile and ubiquitous. It is also a very large phylum relatively and is comprised of numerous taxonomic groups. The breadth of data collected on WREF illustrates that it is well developed and likely approachable as a data collection site with many different kinds of microbiota inhabiting it. The wrangling, analyzing, and plotting of this data was laborious work but yielded an interesting peek at large scale data collection and utilization. Through this process, I was able to develop my skills in R and github as well as strengthen my ability to find patterns in data sets. This will enable me to compile my own methods of demonstrating data in the contexts of presentations and the like in the future.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank Professor Jefferey Blanchard and my team members, Mary McCloskey and Sukhbir Singh, for their guidance and support in creating this project.
